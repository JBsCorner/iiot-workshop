# SENSOR TO CLOUD: HANDS-ON IIOT WORKSHOP

This repository contains a hands-on workshop designed to emulate a complete industrial system: from the sensors that take measurements of the industrial process to the Cloud tools that allow for the storage and analysis of these data.

## USE CASE OVERVIEW
TBD

## ARCHITECTURE BUILDING BLOCKS
TBD

## STEP 01: SENSING THE PHYSICAL WORLD
In this first step, we will use a temperature sensor to determine the temperature of the process at each moment. For this purpose, in addition to a temperature sensor, we will need a device capable of taking measurements every few seconds and recording them. The sensor we will be using is a basic temperature and humidity sensor, specifically the accessible DHT11 model.
